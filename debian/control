Package: zipalign
Architecture: amd64 i386 armel armhf arm64 mips mipsel mips64el
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Zip archive alignment tool
 zipalign is an archive alignment tool that provides important optimization to
 Android application (.apk) files. The purpose is to ensure that all
 uncompressed data starts with a particular alignment relative to the start of

Package: ziptime
Architecture: amd64 i386 armel armhf arm64 mips mipsel mips64el
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Zip archive timestamp remover
 ziptime normalizes the timestamps in the header of a Zip file.  It
 was created as part of the Android SDK to help make reproducible
 builds of Android application (.apk) files. It replaces all
 timestamps in the Zip headers with a static time (Jan 1 2008). The
 extra fields are not changed, so you'll need to use the -X option to
 zip so that it doesn't create the 'universal time' extra.

 Scheme v2. It is the standard tool used to sign APK and JAR files
 distributed as part of Android ROMs.
