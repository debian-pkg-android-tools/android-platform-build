Package: android-platform-build-headers
Section: libdevel
Architecture: amd64 i386 arm64 armel armhf mips mipsel mips64el
Depends: ${misc:Depends}
Description: Transitional dummy package
 This package is for transitional only, feel free to remove it.

Package: zipalign
Architecture: amd64 i386
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Zip archive alignment tool
 zipalign is an archive alignment tool that provides important optimization to
 Android application (.apk) files. The purpose is to ensure that all
 uncompressed data starts with a particular alignment relative to the start of
 the file.

Package: ziptime
Architecture: amd64 i386
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Zip archive timestamp remover
 ziptime normalizes the timestamps in the header of a Zip file.  It
 was created as part of the Android SDK to help make reproducible
 builds of Android application (.apk) files. It replaces all
 timestamps in the Zip headers with a static time (Jan 1 2008). The
 extra fields are not changed, so you'll need to use the -X option to
 zip so that it doesn't create the 'universal time' extra.

Package: android-logtags-tools
Architecture: all
Depends: python, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Tools from AOSP that process event-log-tags files
 This package contains Python scripts from AOSP repository platform/build that
 process event-log-tags (.logtags) files. It contains:
   * java-event-log-tags
   * merge-event-log-tags
 They are used in the process of building the Android platform framework
 "android.jar".
