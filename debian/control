 ziptime normalizes the timestamps in the header of a Zip file.  It
 was created as part of the Android SDK to help make reproducible
 builds of Android application (.apk) files. It replaces all
 timestamps in the Zip headers with a static time (Jan 1 2008). The
 extra fields are not changed, so you'll need to use the -X option to
 zip so that it doesn't create the 'universal time' extra.
