# There are a bunch of libraries that are shared among the Android tools. In
# the Google builds, they are often statically linked into each binary. Here,
# there is /usr/lib/android for the shared versions.  The idea is that only
# the Android tools will link to them since they have no proper public
# interface and are not versioned at all.  These libraries are meant to be
# built from source along with the utilities that use them all in one giant
# release process.
