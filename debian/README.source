The source code has been excerpted form the git repository
 https://android.googlesource.com/platform/build

The Android project does not release tarballs of their core software. This
package source repo is configured following git-buildpackage's manual, under
"When upstream uses GIT/No upstream tarballs":

* http://honk.sigxcpu.org/projects/git-buildpackage/manual-html/gbp.import.html#GBP.IMPORT.UPSTREAM-GIT
* file:///usr/share/doc/git-buildpackage/manual-html/gbp.import.html#GBP.IMPORT.UPSTREAM-GIT

If you want to update the source git repo for this package to a newer release,
then fetch the new commits from the upstream git repo:

 git remote add upstream https://android.googlesource.com/platform/build
 git fetch upstream

debian/gbp.conf is set up to use upstream's release branches and build
tarballs from there.
